# Hi there! <img src="icons/Hi.gif" width="35" /> I'm Rodrigo Rodrigues

I am an undergraduate student in Computer Science at the [University of SÃ£o Paulo](https://www5.usp.br/). I'm currently part of **[Zenith Aerospace](https://github.com/zenitheesc)**. My favorite topics in Computer Science are Algorithm Design, Digital Image Processing, Software Engineering and Data Engineering. Trying to explore new technological concepts and take advantage of them to create cool stuffs :)
